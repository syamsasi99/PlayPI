# PlayPI

PlayPI (pronounced as Play-P-I, similar to API) is an open-source, simple, and local API playground that allows software engineers to test and experiment with various types of APIs. It is designed for hands-on learning and testing without requiring an internet connection or complex setup. 

With PlayPI, you can practice API testing across multiple technologies and protocols, including RESTful, gRPC, GraphQL, and WebSocket (and more to come). You can also use this playground if you are conducting a hands-on API testing workshop or bootcamp.

----------

## Why PlayPI?

PlayPI stands out as a versatile, multi-protocol API playground:

-   **Multiple API protocols**: Includes RESTful, gRPC, GraphQL, and WebSocket APIs (and more to come).
-   **Realistic use cases**: Each API implements meaningful functionalities such as inventory management, task management, user registration, and live chat.
-   **Offline testing**: No internet connection is required; all APIs run locally.
-   **Ease of use**: Simple CLI and Docker-based installation options make it beginner-friendly.

## Web Dashboard (NEW!)

Manage all PlayPI services from your browser with the new web dashboard.

### Start the Dashboard

```bash
./playpi start dashboard
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Features

- Start/stop any service with one click
- Real-time service status updates
- View service details (ports, descriptions)
- Monitor all services from one place
- Perfect for workshops and demos

### Available Services in Dashboard

All 6 API services can be controlled:
- RESTful Inventory Manager (port 8080)
- RESTful Task Manager (port 8085)
- GraphQL Inventory Manager (port 8081)
- gRPC Inventory Manager (port 8082)
- gRPC User Registration (port 8084)
- WebSocket Live Chat (port 8086)

----------

## Quick Start Using CLI

### Download the Binary

1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/abhivaikar/PlayPI/releases/latest) page of this repository.
2.  Download the binary for your platform (only macOS & Linux supported currently).
3.  Make the binary executable (if required):
    `chmod +x playpi`

### Run Individual Services
Use the following command to start a specific service:
`./playpi start [api-type]`

Replace `[api-type]` with one of the following:
-   `dashboard` (NEW! Web-based management UI)
-   `restful-inventory-manager`
-   `restful-task-manager`
-   `graphql-inventory-manager`
-   `grpc-inventory-manager`
-   `grpc-user-registration`
-   `websocket-live-chat`

### Example:
`./playpi start restful-inventory-manager`

## Docker Installation and Usage

### Option 1: Run the Dashboard (Recommended)

The easiest way to use PlayPI with Docker is to run the dashboard, which lets you manage all services from your browser.

#### Pull the Docker Image
```bash
docker pull taqelah/playpi_dashboard:latest
```

#### Run the Dashboard
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 -p 8084:8084 -p 8085:8085 -p 8086:8086 taqelah/playpi_dashboard:latest
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:8000**

From the dashboard, you can:
- Start/stop any service with one click
- View real-time service status
- Test API endpoints interactively
- Access all 6 services from one interface

**Exposed Ports:**
- `8000` - Web Dashboard
- `8080` - RESTful Inventory Manager
- `8081` - GraphQL Inventory Manager
- `8082` - gRPC Inventory Manager
- `8084` - gRPC User Registration
- `8085` - RESTful Task Manager
- `8086` - WebSocket Live Chat

### Option 2: Run Individual Services

If you prefer to run a specific API service directly:

#### Pull the Docker Image
```bash
docker pull abhijeetvaikar/playpi:latest
```

#### Run a Specific Service
```bash
docker run -p <port>:<port> abhijeetvaikar/playpi start [api-type]
```

Replace `<port>` and `[api-type]` as needed.

#### Examples:
```bash
# Start RESTful Inventory Manager
docker run -p 8080:8080 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start restful-inventory-manager

# Start RESTful Task Management API
docker run -p 8085:8085 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start restful-task-manager

# Start GraphQL inventory Management API
docker run -p 8081:8081 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start graphql-inventory-manager

# Start gRPC inventory management API
docker run -p 8082:8082 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start grpc-inventory-manager

# Start gRPC user registration API
docker run -p 8084:8084 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start grpc-user-registration

# Start websocket live chat API
docker run -p 8086:8086 abhijeetvaikar/playpi start websocket-live-chat
```

## Accessing a service once started
Which client you want to use to access the service on the playground is entirely upto you. But here are some suggestions.
-   **RESTful API**: Use Postman or curl or via your favourite programming language at `http://localhost:<port>`.
-   **gRPC API**: Test with grpcurl or Postman or via your favourite programming language on `localhost:<port>`.
-   **WebSocket API**: Connect using a WebSocket client like Postman or WebSocket King at `ws://localhost:<port>`.
- **GraphQL API**: Connect using a GraphQL client like Postman, GraphiQL, Insomnia or your favourite programming language at `http://localhost:8081/graphql`
